# Aluminium

A discord bot and CLI that scrapes a restaurant's website to allow easier access to the daily menu.

## Why we made this

During an intership we did together for our school, we ate lunch daily at this restaurant that's nearby, called "alumix".
Their menu changes everyday, but it's similar for each day of the week (every wednesday is similar to eachother),
so it can "predict" what will be on the menu for any given day.
